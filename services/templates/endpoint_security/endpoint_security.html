              Comodo's Advanced Endpoint Protection solution, utilizes a Default
              Deny Platform to provide complete protection against zero-day
              threats, while having no impact on end-user experience or
              workflows. All untrusted processes and applications are
              automatically contained in a secure environment, allowing safe
              applications the freedom to run while denying malware the system
              access they require to deliver their payloads. In addition,
              Comodo’s Advanced Endpoint Protection solution is integrated with
              Comodo’s local, and cloud-based Specialized Threat Analysis and
              Protection (STAP) engine. This provides an Accelerated Verdict of
              unknown files into either known good, or known bad, thus keeping
              unknown files in containment the shortest time of any solution on
              the market.

              In a world where preventing all cyberattacks is impossible, Comodo
              Cybersecurity provides Active Breach Protection with its
              cloud-delivered cybersecurity platform. The Comodo Cybersecurity
              Platform provides a zero trust security environment that verdicts
              100% of unknown files. The platform renders an almost immediate
              verdict on the status of any unknown file, so it can be handled
              accordingly by either software or human analysts. This shift from
              reactive to proactive is what makes Comodo Cybersecurity unique
              and gives us the capacity to protect your business – from network

              Comodo’s Default Deny Platform places emphasis on allowing known
              good applications, denying everything else until a verdict is
              reached. In order to execute on this strategy, identifying known
              good and known bad applications is critical. As the #1 largest
              certificate authority brand in the world, Comodo is uniquely
              positioned to identify known good software publishers,
              applications (whitelists); while our installed base of over 85
              million users provides the Comodo Threat Research Lab (CTRL) with
              one of the largest caches of known bad files (blacklists). Our
              global product development and malware research team has security
              professionals working 24x7x365 worldwide to ensure that unknown

              Deny Platform to the table, leveraging automated containment
              technology as a temporary solution for analysis to verdict unknown
              files with dual STAP behavioral analysis engines, to determine
              each unknown file’s true state. In the past, organizations have
              had to deploy multiple solutions to accomplish these tasks. Today,
              Comodo has integrated these critical components under a single,
              unified cloud-accessible Advanced Endpoint Protection management
              platform.
