            <p>
              Critical to the learning process is an infrastructure that
              delivers and manages instructional content, identifi es and
              assesses individual and organizational learning, tracks the
              progress towards meeting those goals, and collects and presents
              data for supervising the same. A learning management system
              delivers content but also handles skills gap analysis, tracking,
              and reporting.
